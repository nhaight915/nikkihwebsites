        <h2 id="introduction">How To Use This Website</h2>
        <p>The Haight Family Website has been created and designed to facilitate planning and to keep everyone on the same page. As new information comes out, this website will be updated. </p>

        <h3>Keeping Track</h3>
        <p>Utilize the menu at the top of the page. However, to summarize the capabilities of this website, it is nice to know the following things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Refer to the checklist page for helpful "to-do" reminders. Here you will find important tasks, such as "Submit your summer availability"</li>
            <li>As the vacation plans develop, information can be found under the itinerary section</li>
            <li>Once accomodations have been made, they will be listed for the group to see</li>
            <li>To help keep track of flights, submit your flight info under the Flights page</li>
            <li>If you'd like to request something for the itinerary (e.g. city, activity, etc.), or you'd simply like to communicate plans privately, utilize the Requests page</li>
            <li>Communicate with the group using the Community Board </li>
            
        </ol>
